# RubyWordSearch
 The final project for Ruby Programming II at Spokane Community College.
 main.rb takes a word list (.txt file) and a size parameter (up to 45) and returns a .pdf of a randomized word search, as well as the answer key. An example .txt word list and .pdf word search are included in this repository as well.
